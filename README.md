# About the Repository
Agentic AI Playbook is a comprehensive collection of resources, design patterns, and implementations for building Agentic AI systems. Inspired by leading research, including Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents", this repository explores workflows, modular architectures, and data engineering strategies that power scalable AI agents. This is a curated collection of resources, frameworks, and practical implementations for building and understanding Agentic AI systems. Inspired by leading research, including Anthropic's 'Building Effective Agents' guide, this repository explores workflows, patterns, and design principles for developing robust AI agents.

# What You'll Find Here
- Design Patterns: Prompt chaining, routing, orchestrator-workers, evaluator-optimizer loops.
- Data Engineering for Agentic AI: Strategies for data pipelines, real-time data availability, and context management tailored for agent workflows.
- Frameworks: Insights into tools like LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock, and more.
- Practical Implementations: Use-case-driven code examples, such as personalized shopping assistants and healthcare agents.
- Learning Resources: Links to papers, technical documentation, and expert tutorials.

# Core Focus Areas
- Agent vs Workflow Architectures: Understanding when to use predefined workflows versus dynamic agents.
- Model Context Protocol (MCP): Seamless integration with tools, APIs, and external systems.
- Agent-Computer Interface (ACI): Design robust interfaces for tool and system integration.
- Composable Patterns: Build scalable and maintainable workflows using modular design principles.
- Data Engineering for Agentic AI: Real-time data pipelines, data retrieval optimization, and context-aware data flows for agentic architectures.

# Why This Matters
Agentic AI systems represent a fundamental shift in how AI interacts with tools, external services, and dynamic environments. By focusing on simplicity, composability, and data readiness, this repository aims to provide a practical foundation for building scalable and effective agent-based architectures.
