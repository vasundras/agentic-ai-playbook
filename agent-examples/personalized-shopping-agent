# Practical Application: Building a Personalized Shopping Assistant
This is inspired by the broad principles and patterns covered in Anthropic's Guide for building effective AI agents. Here, we explore a practical application: building a personalized shopping assistant. We'll see how core concepts from the guide can transform the B2C shopping experience while maintaining the guide's emphasis on simplicity and effectiveness.

# The first decision - is it an agent or a workflow?
Based on the guide's definitions, our shopping assistant should be implemented as an agent rather than a workflow for several key reasons:
Dynamic Decision Making: Shopping interactions require flexible, context-aware responses that can't be predetermined. As the guide notes, agents are systems "where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage."
Open-ended Problems: Shopping queries can take many forms and require different combinations of tools and approaches that can't be hardcoded into fixed workflows.
Environmental Feedback: The system needs to continuously adapt based on inventory changes, user responses, and other real-time factors.

# Moving on to - Pattern Selection
Among the patterns described in the guide, we'll primarily use the Orchestrator-Workers pattern, supplemented with Routing for specific subtasks. 
Here's why:
1. Our central orchestrator can decompose complex shopping queries ("I need a business casual wardrobe suggestions for under $500" - side bar, where can I find this?!)
2. Specialized workers can handle specific aspects:
- Product matching worker
- Price optimization worker
- Style recommendation worker
3. Results can be synthesized into cohesive recommendations

# Why Not Other Patterns:
- Prompt Chaining: Too rigid for dynamic shopping interactions
- Parallelization: Shopping queries typically require sequential, context-aware processing
- Evaluator-Optimizer: Better suited for content generation than interactive shopping

# Next up - Establishing Model Context Protocol
The Model Context Protocol is a crucial concept for building effective AI agents. It provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and services while maintaining a clear understanding of the tools' capabilities and requirements. This is where we need to put ourselves in the agent's shoes.
Here's how we can apply it to our Personalized Shopping Agent
1. Dynamic Tool Discovery: The agent can discover available shopping-related tools. These tools can be added or modified without changing the agent's core logic. Here's where we provide a clear understanding of when and how to use each tool
2. Standardized Interactions: We need to provide a consistent format for product searches and a uniform way to access customer profiles. In addition to this, we need to provide a standardized method for inventory checks and identify a common pattern for order processing
3. Error Handling: One of the most frustrating experiences is when we select a product but its out of stock. We need to define a clear protocol for handling out-of-stock items and a standard way to deal with pricing discrepancies. Apart from this we need to establish a uniform approach to customer preference conflicts.
